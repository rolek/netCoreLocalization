# netCoreLocalization
Sample Localization Project

This project is set up to show up broken localization using RESX files.
The localized part of the app is only Login / Register in the main menu.

The screenshot below shows the "Assembly name" different than "Default namespace".
This is the case where RESX files are not being loaded.
